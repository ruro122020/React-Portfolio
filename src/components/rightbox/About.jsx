          In 2006, I stumbled upon the world of code-based software technologies and it became a hobby.
          Normally, I'm an outdoor enthusiast, but this new fascination quickly grew on me.
          Every day after work, I would come home and dive straight into my computer, losing myself in lines of code.
          What started as mere curiosity soon turned into a passion, and I realized I wanted to make this a career.

        <p className='p-3 text-2xl' style={{ fontFamily: "Caveat" }}>
          Fast forward to last year, in 2023, I made a significant commitment to my newfound love for coding. I enrolled
          in a bootcamp, determined to master the ins and outs of what it takes to be a full-stack software engineer.
          The experience was nothing short of exhilarating. I cherished every part of it, from the moments of frustration
          to the thrilling challenges of the projects I built along the way. It was a journey of self-discovery, constantly
          pushing my limits and expanding my boundaries.
        </p>
        <p className='p-3 text-2xl' style={{ fontFamily: "Caveat" }}>
          Emerging from the bootcamp, I felt confident and eager to collaborate with other developers.
          I have a burning desire to join a team that shares my passion for building software solutions that can make a
          difference in the world, in society, and for everyday people like you and me.
          I'm now on the lookout for a team of developers where I can continue to grow my skills and embrace new
          challenges. I value a healthy work-life balance and am ready to contribute to a great team.
          If you are part of a fantastic team of developers seeking a candidate who has honed their technical skills, is
          eager to learn and ask questions, doesn't shy away from a challenge, and loves developing software,
          let's connect!
